## Core Problem

Most companies rely on:
- CRM reports (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- BI dashboards
- Ad platform dashboards
- Marketing Ops managers
- Manual spreadsheet reporting

This creates:
- Delayed visibility
- Fragmented campaign tracking
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Poor day-to-day campaign ROI clarity
- Expensive marketing ops overhead (~$130K+ salary per hire)

Campaign-level metrics are simple.
The reporting infrastructure around them is not.

## What CampaignHub Does

CampaignHub replaces 90% of day-to-day marketing operations reporting work by:

- Creating standardized campaign structures
- Syncing parent and child campaigns to CRM
- Enforcing naming conventions
- Structuring UTMs and tracking
- Connecting paid media, CRM, and sales data
- Delivering instant daily ROI visibility

It does NOT replace enterprise BI dashboards.
It replaces the manual operational overhead required to maintain campaign-level clarity.

## Target Users

- CMOs
- VP of Marketing
- Growth Leaders
- Demand Gen Directors
- Marketing Operations Leaders (in scaling teams)
- Series B / Series C startups
- Mid-market SaaS companies

## Positioning

“Before You Hire Another Marketing Ops Manager, Read This.”

CampaignHub gives CMOs instant daily campaign ROI visibility across CRM, ads, and sales — without adding headcount.

Instead of hiring a $130K Marketing Ops Manager to maintain spreadsheets and dashboards, CampaignHub automates campaign governance and reporting at the source.

## Differentiation

- HubSpot Campaigns
- Salesforce Campaigns
- BI tools (Looker, Tableau)
- Manual spreadsheet reporting

CampaignHub acts as a campaign governance and activation layer that:

1. Creates CRM campaigns automatically
2. Standardizes tracking structures
3. Enforces attribution hygiene
4. Connects execution to revenue
5. Simplifies campaign-level reporting

It is a system of campaign truth.
